The biggest resource for me has been the Markdown Cheat Sheet on GitHub.  I keep having formatting issues and being able to refer back to.

I also keep finding independent blogs when do rabbit hole reading on certain subjects.  For example last night I was working on the day_5 Hashes, and I was nesting them and looping them and .dig through them.  There wasn't a one site that explained everything I needed to know.  So each site would give part of the answer and I would take notes and save my code and run it.  There hasn't been a site yet that I have needed to bookmark.
